#  Hardware Exploration Framework 
#  This module defines default values and supported nodes for the Hardware Exploration Framework.
#  
#  The following code has been developed for a work package "Hardware Architectures
#  for Low Power ML" contributing to project SustainML (Application Aware, Life-Cycle
#  Oriented Model-Hardware Co-Design Framework for Sustainable, Energy Efficient ML
#  Systems). The project has received funding from European Unionâ€™s Horizon Europe
#  research and innovation programme (HORIZON-CL4-2021-HUMAN-01)
#  under grant agreement No 101070408.
