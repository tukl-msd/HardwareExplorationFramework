# Hardware Library

This library is a modified version of the finn-hlslib library. The original library can be found [here](https://github.com/Xilinx/finn-hlslib).
Modifications include adding multiple new components and modifying existing ones to fit the needs of the SustainML project, such as adding support for different variations of the convolutional layer and different activation functions.
