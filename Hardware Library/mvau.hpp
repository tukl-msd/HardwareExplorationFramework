 * \brief Matrix vector activate function for transposed convolution.
 *
 * The function performs the multiplication between a weight matrix and the input activation vector,
 * accumulating the results and then applying an activation function on the accumulated result.
 * This implementation is only valid for transposed convolution, hence it does not accumulate the results on a per kernel bases,
 * it accumulates the results on a channel wise bases, in other words it's like having a kernel of 1x1. Also, it assumes that the input,
 * is already expanded to the correct dimension so 1|2  should be inputted as 1|1|2|2 if the transpose kernel is 2x2 also it's currently only effective for Kernel of 2x2
 *                                                 3|4                        1|1|2|2
 *                                                                            3|3|4|4
 *                                                                            3|3|4|4
 *
 *
 * \tparam IFMChannels   Number of input feature map channels
 * \tparam OFMChannels   Number of output feature map channels
 * \tparam ConvKernelDim Dimension of the convolution kernel (assumed square) currently only 2 is supported
 * \tparam IFMDim 		 Width and Height of the Input Feature Map (assumed square)
 * \tparam SIMD          Number of input columns computed in parallel
 * \tparam PE            Number of output rows computed in parallel
 * \tparam TSrcI         DataType of the input activation (as used in the MAC)
